Goals for this project:

USER:

2. User should be able to save changes to their shopping list. :white_check_mark:
3. User should be able to add their own category and then add items or delete them. :white_check_mark:
4. User should be able to use the app at ease - interface should be clear and user-friendly. :white_check_mark:


APP DESIGN:

1. The app consists of a few classes that represent categories, items and a whole shopping list. :white_check_mark:
2. Classes can be used independently, but also have methods/functions that connect everything together. :white_check_mark:
3. User interface is simple - list is displayed in a terminal, though it is clean and user-friendly. :white_check_mark:
